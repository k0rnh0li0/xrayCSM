# xrayCSM

A Client Side Mod(CSM) offering xray Features for Minetest And Multicraft Clients.  

This mod works by first asking for ores/nodes which need to be found,  which are specified by the user, searches for those ores/nodes in a given radius, and then sets the waypoints making navigating to them far more easier.  

~ Note: This CSM mod will NOT Work on servers having CSM Restrictions which are normally enabled by DEFAULT on most Minetest Servers.  

Version: 1.0.0
